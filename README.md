# DokiDokiNX!
A hacky port of the original Ren'Py "Doki Doki Literature Club" to the Nintendo Switch.

# Installation
Copy all files from release .zip to the root of your SD card (the "Ren'Py Data" folder is necessary for now due to an input bug, so your character starts off named Lain. Sorry! You can copy your own save to the folder made on any other platform if you prefer.)

# Bugs
Still playing through the port, but here's all I've noticed thus far:
1. No keyboard input, so for anything involving it (ie; name input) you'll have to ransfer your save to a different platform, type it there, then move the save back. Annoying, I know.
